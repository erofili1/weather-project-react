The app loads with data for a default city, currently set to London.

The user sees a search input and a search button.
Under that there is weather information for the city.

If the user types in a city or place that isn't recognised by the API,

I want the Weather.js to display the form but not the WeatherInfo component.

Instead, I would like an error message. 

Is that worth being in it's own component?
